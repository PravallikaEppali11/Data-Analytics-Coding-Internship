Recognizing handwritten digits using Scikit-Learn involves training a machine learning model on a dataset of handwritten digit images, such as the MNIST dataset. 
The dataset is typically divided into a training set and a test set. The model learns from the training set to recognize patterns and features in the images. 
Once trained, the model can predict the digit represented by a new handwritten image. Common algorithms used for this task include Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
Random Forests, KNN Algorithms, and Decision Tree Algorithms. The accuracy of the model can be evaluated by comparing its predictions with the ground truth labels 
in the test set.
